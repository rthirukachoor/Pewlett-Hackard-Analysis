# Employee Database Analysis
## Overview & Purpose of Project:
    Do an analysis on Employee Database of Pewlett-Hackard that contains information about Employees(Employees, Employee Departments, Employee Titles)
    to come up with following insights.
        - Retiring employees per title
        - Employees that are eligible to participate in mentorship program.
        
## Analysis Results:
    While trying to analyze the Employees database to understand the number of employees whoever are getting retired and whichever titles are expected to be impacted, 
    following points were observed.     
        - Around 90,398 employees are getting retired out of 300,024 employees that means around 30%~ of employees are getting retired which is quite a lot of employees are getting retitred.

        - The role which will have maximum number of job openings(29,414) because of maximum retirement is 'Senior Engineer' which is almost like 32%~ (29,414 out of 90,398) out of all roles that will have job openings.

        - There are around 1,549 employees that are qualified for mentoring 90,398 employees. So each mentor need to handle 58~ next generation employees which
        is quite a difficult task. So Pewlett-Hackard needs to rethink about the mentorship eligibility criteria so that more employees can qualify for mentorship
        to handle large number of next generation employees.
